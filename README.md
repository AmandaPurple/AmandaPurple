#Amanda Adams

##Info
Hello! I am Amanda Adams, a computer programming student at St Lawrence College. With a strong interest in art and technology I found that programming was the perfect outlet for me! With skills in C++, Java, C#, HTML, CSS and SQL you will find me an important asset to any team. My favourite classes include Database Administration where Iâ€™ve learned how to implement and design industry worthy databases.
